##Few of the interview questions for python developers
A really good discussion on the topic 
https://redd.it/1knw7z

1. Talk to me about the GIL. How does it impact concurrency in Python? What kinds of applications does it impact more than others?
2. How does Python's garbage collection work?
3. What is the difference between range and xrange? How has this changed over time?
4. Here's a function. Optimize it for me.
5. How do you iterate over a list and pull element indices at the same time?
6. I'm getting a maximum recursion depth error for a function. What does this mean? How can I mitigate the problem?
7. How do you enforce ordering for a dictionary-style object?
8. How does Python's list.sort work at a high level? Is it stable? What's the runtime?
9. What's the difference between a list, dictionary, and array in Python?
10. What does this list comprehension do?
11. Here's a class hierarchy with some methods defined. When I call this function, what gets printed?
12. What is monkeypatching? How can you do it in Python?
13. What are some caveats to pickling? Marshaling?
14. How many ways can you append or concatenate strings? Which of these ways is fastest? Easiest to read?
15. Print me the full pathname of every file in this directory tree.
16. What's wrong with this function?
17. What's your preferred editor? (vim, of course - anything else and they fail.)

18. Do arguments in Python get passed by reference or by value?
19. Why are functions considered first class objects in Python?
20. What tools do you use for linting, debugging and profiling?
21. Give an example of filter and reduce over an iterable object
22. Implement the linux whereis command that locates the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.
23. What are list and dict comprehensions?
24. What do we mean when we say that a certain Lambda expression forms a closure?
25. What is the difference between list and tuple?
26. What will be the output of the following code?
